<h2 class="section_head info">About The Open Data Project</h2>

<p>
  The goal of this project is to make it easy for corporations to publish raw data related to the external 
  impact of their operations, allowing researchers, students and third party application developers to analyze 
  and present the information in useful ways.
</p>

<p>
  Progressive corporations often dedicate significant resources to annual reports describing the impact of 
  their operations with respect to the environment. They do so because they want to make a statement regarding 
  the efforts they are making to serve customer needs in a sustainable way. However, by packaging these data 
  in a glossy, human readable brochure, they are missing out on a wonderful opportunity.
</p>

<p>
  Publishing the raw data online will allow researchers and other interested parties to analyze, compare, and 
  present it in useful ways, beyond the scope of any company's CSR department.
</p>

<p>
  Seventh Generation is the first company to use this platform. Other companies are strongly encouraged to do 
  the same by forking this project, customizing it to their needs, and publishing their own datasets.
</p>

<p>
  The power of the platform grows with each new participant. Join us by unlocking your data!
