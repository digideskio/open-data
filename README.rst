Open Data Platform
==================

The goal of this project is to make it easy for corporations to publish raw
data related to the external impact of their operations, allowing researchers,
students and third party application developers to analyze and present the
information in useful ways.

Progressive corporations often dedicate significant resources to annual
reports describing the impact of their operations with respect to the environment.
They do so because they want to make a statement regarding the efforts they
are making to serve customer needs in a sustainable way. However, by packaging
these data in a glossy, human readable brochure, they are missing out on a
wonderful opportunity.

Publishing the raw data online will allow researchers and other interested
parties to analyze, compare, and present it in useful ways, beyond the scope
of any company's CSR department.

Seventh Generation is the first company to use this platform (online at
http://opendata.seventhgeneration.com). Other companies are strongly encouraged
to do the same by forking this project, customizing it to their needs, and
publishing their own datasets.

The power of the platform grows with each new participant. Join us by unlocking
your data!
